23/1/2023,USER-A462,A-39,A Trip To The Edge of The World - Riyadh Province,Edge of the World Saudi Arabia,"first the good omer abdulamen and mohammed were the drivers and omer the guide  omer speaks great english as does mohammed

omer is a terrific driver you will need this as the roads are worthy of a good 4x4 with good shocks and wide range steering  skills

omer is responsive to text within the hour and once you sign on hes communicative back within minutes

i signed on for a private tour through my hotel the mandarin oriental i did not get that  it ended up being a group with 3 other people  my driver guide was 40 minutes late  this was probably the fault of the hotel concierge more than ghazi tours

now why the 4 stars actually for my driver guide it would be 1 star 1 for just being present while i appreciated the additional cars aka a small caravan for safety i didnt appreciate the lack of 11 care  after all the pricing was for 11  again this could be the hotel or ghazi

it turned out my driverguide worked for ghazi and directly under omer

as part of the pack now we trooped through for photo ops and listened as one would at a flag waving group schpeel  not really what i paid for  and i was treated as leftover bread as i was through the hotel and not direct with ghazi

the car i got lacked a good driver omer was not my driver  at one point the car i was in slid back and tilted precariously to one side omer had to jump in to get the car up the hill  while i appreciated the friendliness of my driver i didnt appreciate the fact he spoke little english didnt know anything about anything not even the ability to translate mashallah

i also didnt appreciate my driverguides lack of awareness and inexperience  for example water and juices are stuffed to the side of the car so you get hot orange juice

inability to tell you where the bathroom is and the fact to forewarn you that the bathrooms lack toilet paper

at the tour sites my driverguide stuffed his hands in his pockets and wandered off  then telling me its his first time at this one place too totally lack of any service  and ghaziomer wasnt responsible for me directly even though my driverguide worked for omer

at a local touristy restaurant my driver guide sat without uttering a word he left to get the car without telling me leaving me to wonder whether i should get an uber  no communication  at the end omer had an emergency left and his guest the other person climbed into my car and was told to be dropped off first

again i was treated as yesterdays stale bread

the car after the restaurant was filthy for some odd reasons  empty bottles of water and orange juices strewn all about  sticky mess in the back

then my driver guide dropped me off at the wrong hotel  he dropped me at the namesake office building across the way  i made my own way back

i gave omer 50 usd tip even though i wasnt his prime guest  50 usd tip for my lazy incompetent driverguide  why because as an american i want them to appreciate we arent all jerks and hopefully they will improve their service

i left my phone cable in my driver guides car  omer dropped his own for me the next day at 830am  i very much appreciated that although i just wanted my own back but i appreciated i got a phone cable

i paid 1500sar through the hotel for what was to be a private tour which wasnt i will bring that up with the mandarin but doubt it will have any impact omer has his own rates so advice go to him ghazi tour direct

more advice whatever you end up doing it will end up as a group tour with ghazi  thats not so bad and in fact i enjoyed the small group  just dont pay for a private and expect a private tour and demand a car with good shocks good tires and competent driver and guide

dont get the driverguide and car that i had you might as well just ride with omer  your back with thank you your tail bone will thank you and you will get back to your own hotel

last bring a packet of tissue paper and make sure your guide knows something about the sites",Wadi Disah Saudi Arabia,no review provided,no review provided,4.7,Natural Landscapes,Riyadh Province,Riyadh,0.9907,2023-01,2023-01,Low Activity,Riyadh Province,1,Low,0.9907,0.923483333

entering the mosque i was enveloped in an atmosphere of deep reverence and spirituality the cool marble floors the intricate islamic calligraphy and the rhythmic chants of labbaik allahumma labbaik resonated in the air creating an ambiance of divine serenity my heart pounded with excitement and reverence as i caught my first glimpse of the kaaba the sacred black cube at the center of the mosque draped in its elegant black and gold kiswah seeing the kaaba for the first time is an unforgettable moment and i felt an overwhelming sense of peace and connection to the divine

joining the throngs of fellow pilgrims from around the world i performed the tawaf circumambulating the kaaba seven times in a counterclockwise direction each step was accompanied by prayers and supplications as i sought forgiveness and blessings from allah despite the crowds there was a profound sense of unity and brotherhood as people of different races and nationalities moved together in harmony bound by their shared faith

after completing the tawaf i proceeded to perform the sai walking seven times between the hills of safa and marwah in commemoration of hagars search for water for her son ishmael the ritual reminded me of the importance of perseverance and trust in allahs mercy

praying in the sacred precincts of masjid alharam with the kaaba in view was an incredibly moving experience each prayer felt more significant and heartfelt as i stood in the same place where millions of muslims had prayed over the centuries the call to prayer echoing through the mosque was a beautiful reminder of the constant presence of allah in our lives

based on cave morphology and interpreted evolutionary history the jabal al qarah caves appear to be significantly different from other limestone caves reported in the as summan plateau
jabal al qarah is known for its tall linear cave passages and narrow canyons
the boxwork of linear passages is better developed here than any other known cave locations in the eastern province
field observations including orientations of the escarpment face of the shedgum plateau joints and fractures coupled with a review of the tectonic history of the region suggest that these caves resulted from erosional enlargement of a series of very deep and narrow jointcontrolled fissures in the hofuf formation petrographic data especially an abundance of wellpreserved palygorskite type clay minerals suggests that the hofuf formation was deposited in a mudflatdominated coastal plain environment",Jeddah Yacht Club & Marina,no review provided,no review provided,4.5,Natural Landscapes,The Eastern Province,Al Ahsa,0.3182,2024-01,2024-01,Low Activity,The Eastern Province,1,Low,0.3182,0.736906667

good sized rooms and the hotel was very clean our floor 8th smelt amazing
helpful friendly staff we would get room service knocking on the door few times during the day asking if we needed anything
close to masjid al haram only a 7min walk
many lifts which were all in service and we never waiting long for a lift
decent wifi
cons
took too long to clear breakfast tables lack of staff at breakfast so tables were left dirty so we could not sit to eat there and were also not allowed to take food up to our room ended up having to wait over 10 mins with food in our hands before a table was cleared
good choice of food but did not have a toaster
showerhead had a lot of limescale was blocking some of the holes but still had enough water coming out to have a decent shower
not many good food restaurants close to the hotel would have to walk approx 10 mins to the al safwa towers mall where there was a food court and a good choice of food there is a restaurant at the hotel but very expensive if not included in your package 75 riyals pp pnight",Makkah,good,no review provided,3.9,Hotels & Accommodations,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,Makkah,0.9185,2023-03,2023-03,Low Activity,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,1,Low,0.9185,0.672161217

asfan fortress also known as qalat asfan has a lot of history its an old structure that was used for defense and as a lookout point the fortress is built with strong stone walls and towers showing its importance in protecting the area

the view from the top gives you a good look at the surrounding landscape showing why this spot was chosen for a fortress you can see how it would have been a key location for watching over the region

although a small area exploring the different parts of the fortress was interesting and it was easy to imagine what life might have been like there in the past the combination of history and the great views makes asfan fortress a worthwhile place to visit",No History,no review provided,no review provided,4.3,Historical Sites,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,Asfan,0.9877,2024-06,2024-06,Low Activity,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,1,Low,0.9877,0.45048

we arrived with 30 min before the last guided tour and we cannot pay directly at the entrance so we downloaded an app and tried to pay into the app with visa mastercard and other options but it didnt work
we were pretty sad because that was the first and probably last chance to see hegra as our next accommodation was at 700km

the stuff was incredibly nice they gave us water juices and shadow
the best part they provide us a jeep and a tour even though we didnt manage to pay inside the app at the end of the tour we wanted to pay them directly in eur but they did not accept any money even if we insisted on quite a bit thats tell a lot about arabic culture and i will always remember about this kind gesture  if they see this review i want to thank them again and tell them they made our trip much much nicer

this place is called the little sister of petra and it is totally worth that nickname  it was very interesting to find out about the history of this place and i particularly loved the last point of the tour where we had a moment of peace and silence i felt totally connected with that old place filled with history

i recently stayed at the dorrar aleiman royal hotel a 5star hotel and had a mixed experience while the hotel has potential there were some issues that need to be addressed to truly reflect its 5star rating

upon arrival we were given a room where the air conditioning was not working despite calling maintenance no one came to check on the issue and when i tried calling again no one picked up i had to visit the reception desk in the morning to report the issue but still no resolution was provided it wasnt until my second visit to the reception desk two hours later that someone was sent to check on the ac the issue was finally acknowledged and we were moved to a better room

the housekeeping department deserves special mention as they did an excellent job keeping our room clean and tidy

however even in the new room there were some issues the hand shower button would get stuck if pressed fully and the sink drain was very slow

on the last night of our stay we experienced another issue  the room ceiling started dripping and leaking water all over the floor however when we reported this to the management they immediately provided us with a new room which was a positive ending to our stay

on a positive note the breakfast options provided were great with a wide variety of choices

overall while dorrar aleiman royal hotel has potential there are some areas that need improvement to truly reflect its 5star rating i appreciate the managements prompt response to the issues we faced but i hope the hotel takes these issues seriously and works to address them as i believe it could be an excellent choice for travelers

impossible that this hotel is a five star hotel
im currently almost at the end of my 5 night stay
location is excellent
reception is very clean
water pressure is great
rooms are spacious
other than that everything is disappointing for a five star hotel
service is terrible  in every department they seem not to care about making you comfortable unfriendly and unhelpfulbecause they get their clients anyway because of their prime location 
breakfast is that of a 2 star hotel  not one day did we have fresh bread or pastries  very small variety i actually requested if it would be possible to cancel my breakfast for the last 3 days after seeing its not getting better  they said theyll try and sort it out and contact me  and they didnt after following up 3 times i then spoke to the manager  he says its not possible after i already missed my breakfast and they wasted my time for so long 
the room doesnt feel clean and comfortable 
i booked a double bed in the main room they gave me two single beds with different heights
 after complaining  they put a blanket under to lift the height 
room had a foul smell
bar fridge wasnt working
the bathroom is really outdated
mattress linen  amenitiessoaps etc and towels are of a 2 star hotel
no teacups in the room
cleaners dont clean nicely at all
they havent cleaned the bathroom even once during my stay 
when i asked for more waters
because we are 4 in the room
he said no
only 3 adults theyll charge for more water

you can be the judge from the few photos
this was after the bed was made by room service
stale parathas

it is a truly dreadful hotel in every aspect it does not deserve 5 stars at all even 3 stars compared to international standards would be generous

the staff are downright rude they are a bad advert for makkah the holiest city on earth and yet the worst mannered people in this hotel from the bellboy to the reception staff no one provides a service they are just dismissive

the rooms are dated and really bad stained walls carpets are dirty acs dont work properly no ventilation no fresh air

no working phone in the room the room is not stocked properly tiny dated tv screens dated decor bathrooms are old and not clean mould around

the restaurant is too small packed out with people unhygienic flies very poor selection no egg station for breakfast

the stay was pleasant like as always usually we prefer hotels in makkah clock towers or safwa tower because of their close vicinity to the haram from dorrar aleiman royal it only take 3 escalators  youre in haram
we stayed in a suite as my parents  sister were with me  the experience was world class truly depicting that youre staying in 5 star  hotel the cleanliness was upto the mark the house keeping services were available till 5pm in the evening  they were very nice  the lobby  lifts were spotless  people at the front desk were cooperative  helping accomodating to your needs as much as they can previously we stayed in this hotel in oct 2022  though my that experience was also very good but this time the services of this hotel bounded me to be their permanent guest whenever i come to mecca for umrah hajj inshaallah
weve also took their package of daily breakfast but as compared to the last 3 times i was bit disappointed this time as food was not upto the mark theyve lessened the variety of their menu refilling was slower  the preservation of curries or soups were not good as it became cold instantly  it was a big task to find the sitting place but all these complaints were justified as once youve to cater for the needs of thousands of the people daily in the morning
but overall i really enjoyed my stay over there once again  best wishes for the administration to maintain their good standards  try to improve in the areas they are lacking keep it up  ",Makkah,very good,no review provided,4.0,Hotels & Accommodations,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,Makkah,0.9864,2023-05,2023-05,Low Activity,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,1,Low,0.9864,0.672161217

review could be rated 4 stars but they are almost unresponsive on any email or google queries which is just bad customer service just look at reviews they have replied to apples with oranges

rooms  lobby are good but washroom fixtures are quite dated some washrooms reek of sewage smell others had water leaking all over the place if you take a shower and we saw insects as well most of usb slots were not working in the rooms so make sure you carry a travel charger

room service was frequent which made it up a bit for the shortcomings and reception was nice as well breakfast  dinner buffet were excellent and the best thing is hotel resides in vicinity of haram so if you are not feeling good you can pray along with the mosque on the r floor

suggestion for the hotel is you know you are in a hot region so just for goodwill install a water fountain in your lobby getting water access to pilgrims will bring you tons of prayers its not expensive either and a winwin situatiin for you

we may stay again due to affordability  the fact that you really just need to sleep while you are there

we went to buy tickets to ithra museum and and childrens museum the ladies in the ticketing do not know the what time the session starts for childrens museum which is a bit odd considering its their job after we got the tickets we headed to ithra museum in the ticket scanning we were informed that 1 section is not allowed for kids that information should have been extended to us by the ladies in the ticketing before we purchased ticket right i told them at the ticket scanning i cant leave my son outside a section while we enjoy the artwork can i now the response was his entrance is free you did not pay for him kinda rude huh someone who seems to be their supervisor aproached me and apologized i wanted to just refund the tickets but i dont want to ruin the experience for my wife and son

we entered arcade 1 after around 3 minutes the guy at the ticket scanning came to us he said i told you that you cant enter here my reply was how should i know which arcade im not allowed to enter there should be someone in the entrance of the arcade to inform guests about thisim clearly irritated at this point

so we left arcade 1 and walked down to arcade 2 art is subjective i was expecting more

arcade 3 the concept was nice it just lacked depth for me the lighting made it difficult to see the sea creatures and other images projected on the walls the interactive stuffs that they have are mostly damaged and  not working probably due to wear and tear or poor maintenance

arcade 4 is very simple but informative i hope they expand this section

we left the ithra musem and waited in the lobby

after less than an hour waiting at the lobby we were finally allowed to enter the kids museum we were warmly welcomed and a guy informed us about the available activities the painting session was composed of giving kids paint and paper with background music playing i thought it could have been a more entertaining and memorable experience for the kids

you can see that the staffs tried their best to entertain however many of the interactive items at the first floor are broken not functioning properly or kind of dirty

review

during my recent visit to jeddah i had the pleasure of exploring the beautiful jeddah corniche an iconic waterfront promenade that stretches along the red sea one of the highlights of my visit was witnessing the grandeur of the jeddah fountain a magnificent display of water and light that left me in awe

as i approached the corniche i was immediately captivated by its vibrant atmosphere the wellmaintained walkways lush greenery and stunning views of the red sea created a serene ambiance that provided a muchneeded escape from the bustling city life

the jeddah fountain also known as king fahd fountain stands tall and proud in front of the corniche it is one of the tallest fountains in the world reaching an impressive height of 312 meters the moment i laid eyes on it i couldnt help but be mesmerized by its sheer beauty and elegance

the fountains synchronized water jets dance gracefully to various musical tunes creating a spectacle that is truly breathtaking as night fell colorful lights illuminated the water jets transforming them into a mesmerizing display of vibrant hues it was a sight to behold and left me feeling enchanted

the corniche itself offers numerous recreational activities for visitors to enjoy from leisurely strolls along the promenade to cycling or jogging on dedicated paths there is something for everyone families can be seen picnicking on wellmanicured lawns while children play in designated play areas

one aspect that impressed me during my visit was how clean and wellmaintained everything was the authorities have done an excellent job in ensuring that visitors have a pleasant experience by providing ample seating areas and clean public facilities

moreover there are several food stalls and restaurants along the corniche offering a variety of cuisines to cater to different tastes whether youre craving traditional saudi arabian dishes or international delicacies youll find plenty of options to satisfy your appetite

however despite all its positive aspects one drawback i noticed during my visit was occasional overcrowding during peak hours this made it slightly challenging to find parking spaces or secure a spot near popular attractions such as the fountain nonetheless with patience and proper planning this can be easily overcome

in conclusion my visit to jeddah corniche in front of jeddah fountain was an unforgettable experience filled with beauty and tranquility the majestic fountain stole my heart with its enchanting display while the corniche itself provided a serene escape from city life if youre ever in jeddah make sure not to miss this captivating destination",King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture - Ithra,no review provided,no review provided,4.8,Modern Attractions,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,Jeddah,0.9991,2023-11,2023-11,High Activity,Aseer Province,6,Medium,0.9991,0.600706667

this was my experience
there were a lot of people it took me 1 hour in the line and in the sun just to get inside and once inside because they have to accommodate so many people in short amount of time you have to keep the line moving

in the end they give you a free quran there 3 to 4 options that you can choose from
theres free cold water dispensers inside and outside there are bathrooms for both men and women

also theres a shop where you can buy different kinds of qurans that they print for very low price which you can put in the masjid nabwi for sadaqah for your loved ones as these are the only qurans exepted in the mosque

battle of uhud is located in saudi arabiabattle of uhud
location within saudi arabia
after suffering defeat at the battle of badr and having their caravans endlessly attacked and plundered by muhammads side the quraysh finally saw the necessity to take strong measures their chief abu sufyan then set out for medina with 3000 troops to confront muhammad12

the early phase of the fighting saw the muslims gaining the initiative the quraysh vanguard began faltering and retreated leaving their camps vulnerable however when muslim victory seemed near the muslim rear guard who were tasked to defend a hill to protect against a possible encirclement abandoned their positions to collect spoils of war left by the fleeing enemy this turn of events was exploited by the quraysh general khalid ibn alwalid who launched a daring cavalry strike in the undefended rear and encircled the muslims thus turning the tide of battle

the battle was seen as a significant setback for the muslims and a minor victory for the quraysh as they would return with an even larger force in the battle of the trench",Grave of Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib Alaihi-Mussalam,no review provided,no review provided,5.0,Religious Sites,Al Madinah Al Munawwarah Province,Madinah,-0.9952,2023-10,2023-10,Low Activity,Al Madinah Al Munawwarah Province,1,Low,-0.9952,0.3874

 historical and religious significance

mount arafat holds immense religious importance for muslims it is here that prophet muhammad pbuh delivered his farewell sermon during his last hajj in the year 632 ce in this sermon he outlined the principles of justice equality and morality emphasizing the importance of unity among muslims and the adherence to islamic teachings

the day of arafat is considered the pinnacle of the hajj pilgrimage on this day pilgrims gather on the plain of arafat from dawn until sunset to stand in prayer and supplication seeking allahs forgiveness and mercy this act known as wuquf is a fundamental component of hajj and without it the pilgrimage is incomplete the significance of arafat in islamic tradition cannot be overstated as it is believed to be a day when allahs mercy and forgiveness are abundantly bestowed upon the pilgrims

the landscape is stark and arid with little vegetation reflecting the harsh desert environment of the arabian peninsula however during the hajj season the plain transforms into a bustling sea of pilgrims all dressed in simple white garments symbolizing purity and equality before allah

 visiting mount arafat

one of the virtues of the day of arafat is that fasting this day expiates for the sins of the past and coming year it was reported from abu qatadah that a man said o messenger of allah what do you think of fasting on the day of arafat he said it expiates for the sins of the previous year and of the coming year muslim
this fasting is mustahab desirable for those who are not on hajj in the case of the one who is on hajj it is not sunnah for him to fast on the day of arafat because the prophet ﷺ did not fast on this day when he was in arafat

the battle unfolded as a sequel to the earlier battle of badr where the muslims under prophet muhammads leadership achieved a remarkable victory against the quraysh tribe of mecca however at uhud the dynamics shifted the muslim army faced a formidable quraysh force led by abu sufyan

one strategic element of the battle is often highlightedthe positioning of archers on the slopes of uhud initially under the prophets command archers were stationed to guard the muslim rear and prevent enemy flanking maneuvers however when the battle seemed to tilt in favor of the muslims some archers left their positions to collect spoils against the prophets orders

this deviation proved catastrophic the quraysh seized the opportunity to launch a surprise attack from the rear causing chaos within the muslim ranks the tide turned leading to significant casualties among the muslims including the injury of prophet muhammad himself

despite this setback the muslims ultimately regrouped and prevented a complete defeat the lessons learned from uhud particularly the importance of discipline and adherence to command reverberate through islamic military strategy and teachings

upon entering i was immediately captivated by the extensive collection of artifacts and exhibits that showcase the daily life traditions and artistic expressions of the local people the museum is wellcurated with detailed descriptions in both arabic and english making it accessible to a wide range of visitors i particularly enjoyed the displays of traditional costumes jewelry and household items which provided a vivid picture of the regions past

one of the highlights of my visit was the heavy rain that poured down during my time at the museum while it might sound unusual to some the rain added a magical touch to the whole experience the lush greenery surrounding the museum became even more vibrant and the sound of the rain enhanced the peaceful and serene atmosphere walking through the museums outdoor areas in the rain was a truly enchanting experience and it made the stunning scenery even more beautiful

however the reason i am giving the museum four stars instead of five is due to a few minor inconveniences firstly the signage within the museum could be improved for better navigation at times it was a bit challenging to find my way around the different sections additionally while the staff were friendly and knowledgeable there could be more interactive elements to engage younger visitors and enhance the overall experience

unremarkable elevator experience the elevator ride lacked any background music replaced by unpleasant mechanical noises

dull design and marketing the overall atmosphere lacked any creativity or engaging marketing elements

uninformed staff staff seemed unsure about elevator capacity raising concerns about safety protocols

limited time on sky bridge the sky bridge itself offered minimal engagement failing to justify the 5minute visit and the 69 sar ticket price

11/5/2024,USER-H58,H-4,ZamZam Pullman Makkah Hotel,Makkah,"they charge 5 star hotel prices for 2 star rooms the only good thing about this how close it is to that haram but theres other better hotels in this tower i would rather to go instead

the lobby is very deceiving looks good only on the outside but its evident how old everything is once you enter the rooms they dont even clean the rooms or stock them

had to call housekeeping right away because there was no towels or soap or anything in the room it took 30 minutes and calling 5 times to get towels to wash our hands there is a visible layer of dust that we had to clean off ourselves they stopped event picking up and answering the phone at a certain point

this hotel is the exact opposite of luxury not worth the price anyone that calls this a 5 star hotel has never been in one",Makkah,very good,no review provided,4.0,Hotels & Accommodations,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,Makkah,-0.4611,2024-05,2024-05,Low Activity,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,1,Low,-0.4611,0.672161217
29/4/2024,USER-H59,H-4,ZamZam Pullman Makkah Hotel,Makkah,this trip was a gift to my parents but they made my parents wait for 23 hours atleast before giving the keys also made me change the reservation name multiple times and the payment link was shared last minute instead of directly cutting the money when i made the reservation the furniture was pretty old in the room and there were bed bugs on the bed the breakfast was topnotch though but im expecting better service next time,Makkah,very good,no review provided,4.0,Hotels & Accommodations,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,Makkah,0.9387,2024-04,2024-04,Low Activity,Makkah Al Mukarramah Province,1,Low,0.9387,0.672161217
